Self-study project following https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/ <br />
This repository is used to record the labs and projects that I have done in this process. <br />
The course has a primary focus on python and object-oriented programming. The first topic of the course is about python including the first three projects (Hog, Cats, Ants). At the meantime, some basic data structures and algorithm are introduced/implemented using python. The second topic of the course introduce scheme and sql. The fourth project is to use python to interpret scheme code. <br />
